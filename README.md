# Asteroids

This Unity project is a recreation of the arcade classic Asteroids in the Unity engine.

It is not intended to be 1-to-1 recreation. This is more of an exercise to practice my own Unity skills than anything else.

## Known Issues

* If the player is able to acquire more than 3 lives, the 4th, 5th and any more consecutive lives will not be displayed on the UI.
